The weekly updates will still take place this Wednesday also.\n\n```fix\n-Fixed the "level skip glitch" which can be done with ladders\n-Fixed a bug that prevented the "Demon Slayer" achievement from unlocking for some\n-Limited the amounts of safes that spawn on levels as there were far too many\n-Fixed cosmetic bugs that can cause in some rare cases vents or lights to spawn over ladders\n-Fixed a very rare bug with the new pool rooms theme where the ladder could spawn outside of the level\n-Batteries are much bigger and sparkle to make them stand out more as previously some players were having issues spotting them\n-Fixed a bug where the player could sometimes manage to jump out through the ceiling\n-Fixed a bug where moving to the "level 0" them wouldn\'t update the new entities to spawn and would use the old ones (i.e going from the circus theme to the level 0 theme would still spawn clowns in level 0, which shouldn\'t have happened)\n-Fixed a bug that prevented textboxes from popping up sometimes (was caused by using a ladder/trapdoor/vent etc while being chased by an entity)\n\nThis unplanned patch update was released due to bug reports on our official discord. Join the discord below to report bugs/leave game suggestions as it is easier to be seen there and grouped into being fixed in unexpected patches like these!\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/qbQhTy2JhK <<< Discord link\n\nCheers!\n```\n[ [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1889640/view/3228526756473864754) | [Wiki](https://the-backrooms-survival.fandom.com/wiki/Updates) ]')

Your footsteps make noise. Sprinting is the loudest, crouching the quietest. This means you need to be careful if just running around aimlessly\n-Entities can hear other noises like doors opening, lights popping, etc. The louder the noise, the further away they can hear it from.\n-added a setting to enable shadows for everything (must be enabled in graphics settings)\n-Added a musket weapon, a single shotgun that uses lead ball ammunition. Both are rare and must be found separately\n-Added a backpack that can be found and increases your maximum inventory by 5 slots\n-added an "unemployed" profession that provides no benefit but it is good for hardcore players looking for a challenge!\n-smilers now cannot jumpscare you if you have a light source out (candle, flashlight, lantern) that has fuel and is lit\n-Vents now spawn further away from the player, this prevents going to a new floor and seeing a vent right above you as an easy skip\n-Fixed a bug where "spamming" the use key button on a vent can cause you to skip multiple levels\n-Fixed a bug where being killed by fire gives you the ending "Killed by entity", it now shows accurately as "Death by accidental causes"\n-Fixed a bug where players\' arms/weapons still showed as pixelated if you turned off PSX settings\n-Added "glowsticks", found in boxes of 30, can be dropped to leave a dim light and act as a trail\n-You can now not jump if your stamina is empty\n-Weapon swinging uses and requires a small amount of stamina\n-Added smashable crates that can be smashed with weapons and may have items inside (does not cost weapon durability)\n-fixed ambient noises still playing on dead/game over screen\n-Fixed lightbulb popping audio not being adjusted by jumpscare volume SFX\n-psychiatrist now starts with two sanity pills\n-Fixed a visual bug where pick up notification didn\'t show for weapons\n-Fixed a visual bug where the panel for picking up notifications\n-Fixed a bug where pausing while the pickup notification typing text is still scrolling causes it to stop and remain unfinished\n-Fixed some typos\n-Fixed a bug where you could jump on the "moleman" entity\'s head\n```\n[ [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1889640/view/3224025075263373635) | [Wiki](https://the-backrooms-survival.fandom.com/wiki/Updates) ]')

We will return now to weekly updates from next week, adding additional content such as the usual new levels, entities, items, and so on.\n\n> Multiplayer gameplay works the same as singleplayer: explore the level and find ways to the next, while picking up items and avoiding entities. Of course, the only difference is other players will be with you!\n\n```Features:\n-Any player can host a room of up to 6 players\n-different player skins/models to choose from (more will be added)\n-Create private rooms (others will need the name to join) or public (will appear in the lobby and anyone can join\n-Proximity voice chat (can be disabled in settings)\n-PvP, players can kill/attack/damage each other. All your items are dropped on death so you can kill and loot players\n-a "revive"/Ressurection system: When another player is killed by an entity, they will enter a "stunned" mode where they will have a countdown timer until they die. Another player can revive them before the counter reaches 0 and they will come back with a third of max health. The countdown time reduces each time until it can no longer work and you will die without being able to be revived\n-the "revive" system only works if you are killed by an entity, so if another player kills you, you will instantly die and drop all your items to be looted\n\nAs expected with a huge new update, there will be some bugs. Please report any bugs, no matter how small, so they can be patched throughout the week!\n\nCheers!\n```\n[ [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1889640/view/3336617587212676014) | [Wiki](https://the-backrooms-survival.fandom.com/wiki/Updates) ]')
