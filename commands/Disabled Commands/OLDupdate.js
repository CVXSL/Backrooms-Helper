The weekly updates will still take place this Wednesday also.\n\n```fix\n-Fixed the "level skip glitch" which can be done with ladders\n-Fixed a bug that prevented the "Demon Slayer" achievement from unlocking for some\n-Limited the amounts of safes that spawn on levels as there were far too many\n-Fixed cosmetic bugs that can cause in some rare cases vents or lights to spawn over ladders\n-Fixed a very rare bug with the new pool rooms theme where the ladder could spawn outside of the level\n-Batteries are much bigger and sparkle to make them stand out more as previously some players were having issues spotting them\n-Fixed a bug where the player could sometimes manage to jump out through the ceiling\n-Fixed a bug where moving to the "level 0" them wouldn\'t update the new entities to spawn and would use the old ones (i.e going from the circus theme to the level 0 theme would still spawn clowns in level 0, which shouldn\'t have happened)\n-Fixed a bug that prevented textboxes from popping up sometimes (was caused by using a ladder/trapdoor/vent etc while being chased by an entity)\n\nThis unplanned patch update was released due to bug reports on our official discord. Join the discord below to report bugs/leave game suggestions as it is easier to be seen there and grouped into being fixed in unexpected patches like these!\n\nhttps://discord.com/invite/qbQhTy2JhK <<< Discord link\n\nCheers!\n```\n[ [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1889640/view/3228526756473864754) | [Wiki](https://the-backrooms-survival.fandom.com/wiki/Updates) ]')
